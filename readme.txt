/// SCHEDULER ///

Not to be confused with an OS Scheduler -- this scheduler is created to help the user manage their time.
I found my self consistently looking at my planner in order to remember what things I have coming up.
Having been about 3/4 of the way through CS 1501, Algorithm Analysis, I decided I would take advantage of
one of the data structures we learned about and teach myself some things about Java's timekeeping classes.

I actually find this program quite useful for how simple it is.
