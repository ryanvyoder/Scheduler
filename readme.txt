/// SCHEDULER ///

This scheduler is created to help the user manage their time.
I found my self consistently looking at my planner in order to remember what things are due soon.
Having been about 3/4 of the way through CS 1501, Algorithm Analysis, I decided I would take advantage of
one of the data structures we learned about and teach myself some things about Java's timekeeping classes.
